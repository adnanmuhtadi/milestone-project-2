# Feature, Functional & Useability Testing

I will be testing all my functions and features within each section of my site and ensuring that it is useable across different browsers which are as follows: Chrome, Edge and Firefox. The devices I would be using to run the tests are as follows: 13inch Macbook Pro, 10.2 inch iPad and 6.5 inch iPhone Pro Max.

A pass would mean that the feature that I am testing has been run on the said browsers and devices, in a situation one of the browsers and/or devices has an issue, it would be considered as a fail.
