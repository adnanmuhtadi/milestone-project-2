<h1 align="center">Milestone Project 2 - Explore The Middle East </h1>

[View project here](#)

This interactive site is where I would be advertising some of the most beautiful countries within the Middle East (Lebanon, UAE, Eygpt, Turkey and Jordan). It will advertise the different attractions and restaurants and other places within the capital of the specific country. It will also advertise the top three places to visit and the three top cuisines known in that country. It will include a method for the user to reach out to the site admin if they would like to know more about a specific country.

This site would be utilising JavaScript from the Code Institute as well as using Google Places API. I will be using various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, APIs (Google Places).  This project will be responsive and accessible to different size browsers and devices.

## User Experience (UX)

### The Audience

The purpose of this site is to advertise the different countries within the Middle East (Lebanon, UAE, Eygpt, Turkey and Jordan) and there top places to visit and dine. The intended audience would be for users who would be interested in visiting these countries and plan an itinerary within the selected countries capital.

### User Objectives

The website will advertise the following countries within the Middle East (Lebanon, UAE, Eygpt, Turkey and Jordan) for users who would like to visit or plan a visit to the selected countries. It will have a carousel of images within the home page which would rotate the images in sequence. Within the homepage, it will also have 9 cardholders which flip when the user hovers over them which would then have a small description of the picture. When the user visits the country page, they would be introduced with the country and the three top places to visit and type of cuisine to try.

When the country is selected and scrolled down, the information would be pulled from a JSON file to keep the information easy to update and dynamic. A Google Place API would be added to each of the specific countries webpage with the fixed coordinates of the capital of those selected countries where it would display the different attractions, restaurants and other google registered places. It will also enable the user to fill out a form which would then be sent to the site admin registered email address.

### My Objectives

My objectives are going to be achieved by taking images from free stock websites which would have images of the countries that I want to advertise. The information of which would be used will be taken from other websites and from my personal experience when I have visited them. A drop-down menu would be on the countries page where they would be able to select which country they would like to see as the information would be pulled from a JSON file. Incorporating Google Places API will help users to plan their holidays if they choose to visit these countries. The users would also be able to contact the site admin if they have any queries or questions on planned itineraries as the site admin has the first-hand experience when visited those places as it would have a contact form which would be linked to a live email address.

I would be using the theme of sand as the Middle East is known for the sandy desert. The pictures used on the site would be the main representative of achieving the goal of advertising the countries. Within the footer, there would be social media links which would connect the user to the advertising agency social media links (this would be linked to just the home pages of the social media sites).
