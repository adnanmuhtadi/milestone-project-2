<h1 align="center">Milestone Project 2 - Explore The Middle East</h1>

[View project here](https://adnanmuhtadi.github.io/milestone-project-2/)

This interactive site is where I would be advertising some of the most beautiful countries within the Middle East (Lebanon, UAE, Eygpt, Turkey and Jordan). It will advertise the different attractions and restaurants and other places within the capital of the specific country. It will also advertise the top three places to visit and the three top cuisines known in that country. It will include a method for the user to reach out to the site admin if they would like to know more about a specific country.

This site would be utilising JavaScript from the Code Institute as well as using Google Places API. I will be using various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, APIs (Google Places).  This project will be responsive and accessible to different size browsers and devices.

## User Experience (UX)

### The Audience

The purpose of this site is to advertise the different countries within the Middle East (Lebanon, UAE, Eygpt, Turkey and Jordan) and there top places to visit and dine. The intended audience would be for users who would be interested in visiting these countries and plan an itinerary within the selected countries capital.

### User Objectives

The website will advertise the following countries within the Middle East (Lebanon, UAE, Eygpt, Turkey and Jordan) for users who would like to visit or plan a visit to the selected countries. It will have a carousel of images within the home page which would rotate the images in sequence. Within the homepage, it will also have 9 cardholders which flip when the user hovers over them which would then have a small description of the picture. When the user visits the country page, they would be introduced with the country and the three top places to visit and type of cuisine to try.

When the country is selected and scrolled down, the information would be pulled from a JSON file to keep the information easy to update and dynamic. A Google Place API would be added to each of the specific countries webpage with the fixed coordinates of the capital of those selected countries where it would display the different attractions, restaurants and other google registered places. It will also enable the user to fill out a form which would then be sent to the site admin registered email address.

### My Objectives

My objectives are going to be achieved by taking images from free stock websites which would have images of the countries that I want to advertise. The information of which would be used will be taken from other websites and from my personal experience when I have visited them. A drop-down menu would be on the countries page where they would be able to select which country they would like to see as the information would be pulled from a JSON file. Incorporating Google Places API will help users to plan their holidays if they choose to visit these countries. The users would also be able to contact the site admin if they have any queries or questions on planned itineraries as the site admin has the first-hand experience when visited those places as it would have a contact form which would be linked to a live email address.

I would be using the theme of "Sandy Yellow colour" as the Middle East is known for the sandy desert. The pictures used on the site would be the main representative of achieving the goal of advertising the countries. Within the footer, there would be social media links which would connect the user to the advertising agency social media links (this would be linked to just the home pages of the social media sites).

## User Stories

The intended type of users which this site would be targeted for are individuals, couples and/or families who are looking to plan a holiday to the Middle East.

1. As a user, I want to be able to see images of the places in the middle east so I can see the beauty of the countries.
2. As a user, I want to know more about a picture when hovering over it so I know more about what I am looking at.
3. As a user, I want to be able to select a country from a drop-down so I can see what other countries I can see more information about.
4. As a user, I want to see different attractions in the capital of the chosen country so I can see the options to choose from.
5. As a user, I want to click on an option that is presented to me within the Google Places API and have it appear on the marker within the map.
6. As a user, I want to be able to select a different country and have the information change so I can see the new information without being transferred to another page.
7. As a user, I want to be able to contact the site admin so I can ask questions that I would need further assistance on.
8. As a user, I want to be able to click on the social media links to lead me to the "Advertising Agency" so I can follow their advertisement.

## Design

-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   I kept the colour scheme sandy yellow to advertise the desert of the middle east with the black writing to keep the text easy to read (Used  [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check the contrast of the colour scheme).

-   #### Typography
    -   I have chosen to use Yatra One and Kalam font as the main fonts throughout the website with Sans Serif as the emergency font in the case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly. Both Yatra One and Kalam are attractive fonts to use as it shows the middle eastern effect with the decorations and curves they use for their writing.

-   #### Imagery
    -   The images that were used are based on the content of what it is portraying. Displaying the places to visit and cuisines to eat around the countries I am focusing on.
